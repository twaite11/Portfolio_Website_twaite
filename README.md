**Welcome to tylerwaite.com.** This is not just a portfolio; it is a fully interactive web experience designed to emulate the **Windows Vista (Aero)** operating system from the mid-2000s. While the interface is retro, the backend is powered by modern AI engineering, featuring custom tools built with PyTorch Geometric and the Gemini API.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 The "Aero" UI
- **Vista Aesthetic:** Full implementation of the "Frutiger Aero" gloss style, including the Start Orb, transparent glass borders, and sidebar gadgets.
- **Window Management:** Draggable, resizable, and minimizable windows built with React state management.
- **Filesystem Navigation:** Browse projects and credentials as if they were files in Windows Explorer.

### 🧠 AI & Backend Tools
- **Graph Neural Networks:** Integrated **PyTorch Geometric** models to visualize complex data structures directly in the browser.
- **Generative AI:** Interactive chat and analysis tools powered by the **Google Gemini API**.
- **Data Persistence:** A lightweight **SQLite3** database handles user sessions and interaction logs.
- **Python Backend:** A robust Python API serves the machine learning inference and handles database transactions.
